# üöÄ CRM Analytics Lab

## üè¢ Business Problem

Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses‚Äîlosing customers means losing revenue and growth opportunities. Traditional analytics often fail to provide actionable, real-time insights for retention and segmentation.

**This project solves:**
- üîç **Who is likely to churn?**
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **How are customers segmented?**
- üìä **What drives customer value and engagement?**
- ü§ñ **How can business users interact with analytics easily?**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Approach

This solution is a **full-stack CRM analytics platform** built with Python, Flask, and modern data science libraries. It provides:

- **Automated Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
  Cleans, engineers, and scales features for robust modeling.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization**  
  Generates insightful charts (e.g., churn by segment, spend distribution, clustering, sentiment, survival analysis) using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

- **Customer Segmentation**  
  - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring
  - Clustering with `KMeans` and `DBSCAN`
  - Dimensionality reduction with `PCA`

- **Churn Prediction**  
  - Models: `LightGBM`, `RandomForest`, `XGBoost`
  - Handles class imbalance with `SMOTE`
  - Evaluates with cross-validation and confusion matrices

- **Explainable AI**  
  - `SHAP` for feature importance and model transparency

- **Time Series Forecasting**  
  - `ARIMA` for spend prediction

- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  - `TextBlob` for customer feedback

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  - Built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - üéõÔ∏è **KPI cards** for instant business metrics
  - üìà **Dynamic chart grid** with slider to control chart visibility
  - üí¨ **Chatbot** for business Q&A

- **REST API**  
  - Endpoints for health, summary, customer data, churn risk, prediction, and visualizations

## üìä Visualizations Included
